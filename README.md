### TODO

- Add universal "deactivate/activate by default," similar to [Genesis Title Toggle](https://github.com/billerickson/genesis-title-toggle)
- Updated `uninstall.php` to remove post meta data (currently only removes the unused settings field, see [Issue #1](https://github.com/joshuadavidnelson/scripts-to-footer/issues/1))
